## About

By default the Arduino only has as debug possibility via the Serial port.
This has a few disadvantages:

- requires a physical cable to the Arduino device (if the device is far away or in a remote location this is not easy)
- debugging multiple Arduinos at the same time requires many serial ports and a lot of cables

With the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) or ESP32 we now have network connectivity which can be used for streaming debugging information in real-time.

This library is good for IoT projects, mobile robots (can debug it in moviment with a cable ?),
WiFi or BLE projects, etc.

The MiP_ESP8266_Library is a example of this. see in:  https://github.com/Tiogaplanet/MiP_ESP8266_Library

_RemoteDebug_ is improved with client buffering (is last send is <= 10ms),
to avoid misterious delays of networking on ESP32 and ESP8266 boards

Note: If your project is not wireless, you can use my another library,
the lightweight __SerialDebug__.

## Telnet

Telnet is a standard way of remotely connecting to a server and is supported on all operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux...).

MacOSx and Linux have a native telnet client.

For Windows, a typical telnet client is the __Putty__: https://www.putty.org/ .

Have a good tool for mobiles: the __Fing__, please find it in your mobile store.
Its show all devices in local network, show ports opened and can execute the telnet client too (external App)

_RemoteDebug_  sets-up a telnet server which is listening to any telnet client that wants to connect. After connection, logging is streamed to the telenet client.

_RemoteDebug_ is very simple to use, after a few lines of initialization code, you can use the well-known "print" commands to stream your logging to the remote client.

### Debug levels

_RemoteDebug_ supports the filtering of logging based on **debug levels**:

Only show for it actual debug level:

    - Verbose
    - Debug
    - Info
    - Warnings

Note: These levels are in the order of most-logging -> least-logging.

Or for always show (not depends of actual debug level):

    - Any 
    - Errors 

Note: All debugs is processed and showed only if have a client connection.

The telnet client can set the debug level by typing a few simple commands.

### Profiler

_RemoteDebug_ includes a simple profiler. It can be enabled by the connected telnet client or the Arduino code itself.

When enabled, it shows the time between 2 debug statements, using different colors depending on the elapsed time.

A typical example would be to insert logging just before and after a function after which you can see how much the is spent in the function.

### Lightweight

_RemoteDebug_ is designed to give minimal overhead (connected or not) and 
only process debugs,if there is a telnet client connected.

### Custom commands

_RemoteDebug_ supports custom commands that can be entered in the telnet client. These trigger the execution of a custom function in the Arduino code. For example this can be used to send back a status on request of the telnet client.

##DISCLAIMER:

The current version of _RemoteDebug_ does not yet include any authentication and is intended only for development.

Future extension could include a secure way for authentication and further testing to support production environments.
  
## News

In 1.5.0 version, we have rdebug* macros (see below), 
debugs with auto funcion name and core id (core id only for ESP32).
And new rdebug?ln macros to put auto new line.

So:
```cpp
void foo() {

  uint8_t var = 1;

  rdebugVln("this is a debug - var %u", var); // see a suffix ln in rdebug macro
}

void loop() {

  // ....

  foo();

  // ....
}
```
It will show in telnet client: 
````
(V p:^0000ms) (foo)(C1) this is a debug - var 1
````
    Where:  V -> verbose
            p -> profiler time
            (foo) -> this is a function name that calls the rDebug*
            (C1) -> It is running it Core 1 (only for ESP32)

And You can change port number in begin method (see below)

## Wishlist

    - Http page to begin/stop the telnet server
    - Authentication as telnet support (kerberos, etc.) to support production environment

## Usage

###includes

```cpp
#include "RemoteDebug.h" // Remote debug over telnet - not recommended for production, only for development       
```
###instance

RemoteDebug Debug;

###setup

- In the setup function after WiFi initialization
```cpp
// Initialize the telnet server of RemoteDebug

Debug.begin("Telnet_HostName"); // Initiaze the telnet server - this name is used in MDNS.begin

// OR

Debug.begin(HOST_NAME); // Initiaze the telnet server - HOST_NAME is the used in MDNS.begin

// OR

Debug.begin(HOST_NAME, PORT); // Initiaze the telnet server - HOST_NAME is the used in MDNS.begin

// OR

Debug.begin(HOST_NAME, startingDebugLevel); // Initiaze the telnet server - HOST_NAME is the used in 

// OR

Debug.begin(HOST_NAME, PORT, startingDebugLevel); // Initiaze the telnet server - HOST_NAME is the used in 

// Options

Debug.setResetCmdEnabled(true); // Enable the reset command

// Debug.showProfiler(true); // To show profiler - time between messages of Debug

```
- In the tail of loop function
```cpp
// Remote debug over telnet

Debug.handle();

```
- In any place of you code:
```cpp
if (Debug.isActive(Debug.<level>)) {
    Debug.printf("bla bla bla: %d %s", number, str); // OR
    Debug.printf("bla bla bla: %d %s", number, str.c_str()); // Note: if type is String need c_str() // OR
    Debug.println("bla bla bla 2 ln");
    Debug.printf("float: %f\n", value); // Not works in ESP8266 :-(
    // Note: to show floats with printf (ESP8266 only),
    // you can use my ArduinoUtil library -> https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/ArduinoUtil
    Debug.printf("float: %s\n", Util.formatFloat(value, 0, 5).c_str());
}
```
Or short way (new) (prefered if only one debug at time):
```cpp

rdebugA("This is a any (always showed) - var %d\n", var);
rdebugV("This is a verbose - var %d\n", var);
rdebugD("This is a debug - var %d\n", var);
rdebugI("This is a information - var %d\n", var);
rdebugW("This is a warning - var %d\n", var);
rdebugE("This is a error - var %d\n", var);

rdebugV("This is a println\n"); // Note: if you want a simple println you must ended with new line characters

// Or with new ln macros:

rdebugAln("This is a any (always showed) - var %d", var);
rdebugVln("This is a verbose - var %d", var);
rdebugDln("This is a debug - var %d", var);
rdebugIln("This is a information - var %d", var);
rdebugWln("This is a warning - var %d", var);
rdebugEln("This is a error - var %d", var);

rdebugVln("This is a println");
```
Instead of rdebug can be used old short way: 
```
DEBUG_A(...)
DEBUG_V(...)
DEBUG_D(...)
DEBUG_I(...)
DEBUG_W(...)
DEBUG_E(...)
````

- An example of use debug levels: (supposing the data is a lot of characteres)
```cpp
if (Debug.isActive(Debug.VERBOSE)) { // Debug message long
    Debug.printf("routine: data received: %s\n", data.c_str()); // Note: if type is String need c_str()
} else if (Debug.isActive(Debug.DEBUG)) { // Debug message short
    Debug.printf("routine: data received: %s ...\n", data.substring(0, 20).c_str()); // %.20s not working :-|
}
```

- An example of use debug with serial enabled
  Useful to see messages if setup or
  in cause the ESP8266/ESP32 is rebooting (telnet connection stop before received all messages)
  Only for this purposes I suggest it
```
// Setup after Debug.begin

Debug.setSerialEnabled(true);

// All messages too send to serial too, and can be see in serial monitor
```

 - For reduce overheads RemoteDebug is disconnect the telnet client if it not active.
 - Please pless enter or any key if you need keep the connection
 - The default is 5 minutes (You can change it in RemoteDebug.h)  
 - You can use mDNS to register each node with different name, it helps to connect without know the IP.

 - Please not forget to use if clause with Debug.isActive (if not using rdebub*)
   ---> This is very important to reduce overheads and work of debug levels

 - Please see the samples, basic or advanced, to learn how to use  

 - In advanced sample, I used WifiManager library, ArduinoOTA and mDNS, please see it.

# Know issues

- Sometimes (rarely) the connection over telnet becomes very slow.
  Especially right after uploading firmware.
  Reset command in telnet connection or turn off/on can be resolve it.
  But I need find why it occurs

## Thanks

First thanks a lot for Igrr for bring to us the Arduino ESP8266.
